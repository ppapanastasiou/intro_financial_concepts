# Salary and taxes
# You just got a new job as an entry-level Data Scientist at a technology company in New York City with a decent starting salary of $85,000 per year.
#
# Unfortunately, after state and local taxes, you can expect to be sending roughly 30% back to the government each year.
#
# You will need to calculate your monthly take home pay after taxes in order to begin budgeting.

# Assume a 30% tax rate and a base salary of $85,000.
# Calculate your take home salary after taxes.
# Calculate your monthly salary after taxes (Hint: You can use simple division in this case).

# Enter your annual salary
salary = 85000

# Assume a tax rate of 30%
tax_rate = 0.30

# Calculate your salary after taxes
salary_after_taxes = salary*(1 - tax_rate)
print("Salary after taxes: " + str(round(salary_after_taxes, 2)))

# Calculate your monthly salary after taxes
monthly_takehome_salary = salary_after_taxes / 12
print("Monthly takehome salary: " + str(round(monthly_takehome_salary, 2)))


# Monthly expenses and savings
# In order to make it in New York City, you have decided to split a two-bedroom apartment with a friend. You will have to budget for rent, food and entertainment, but it's also a good idea to allocate an amount for unforeseen expenses each month. This unforeseen expenses budget could be used for anything ranging from new clothes or electronics to doctor appointments.
#
# Set up your monthly budget as follows:
#
# Rent: $1200 / month (Includes utilities)
# Food: $30 / day (On average. Includes groceries and eating out.)
# Entertainment: $200 / month (Movies, drinks, museums, partiesâ€¦)
# Unforeseen Expenses: 250 / month (Stay safe, and don't drop your phone!)
# For this application, assume an average of 30 days per month. Whatever is left after your paying your monthly expenses will go into your savings account each month.
#
# monthly_takehome_salary from the previous exercise is available.

# Enter your monthly rent
monthly_rent = 1200

# Enter your daily food budget
daily_food_budget = 30

# Calculate your monthly food budget assuming 30 days per month
monthly_food_budget = daily_food_budget * 30

# Set your monthly entertainment budget
monthly_entertainment_budget = 200

# Allocate funds for unforeseen expenses, just in case
monthly_unforeseen_expenses = 250

# Next, calculate your total monthly expenses
monthly_expenses = monthly_rent + monthly_food_budget + monthly_entertainment_budget + monthly_unforeseen_expenses
print("Monthly expenses: " + str(round(monthly_expenses, 2)))

# Finally, calculate your monthly take-home savings
monthly_savings = monthly_takehome_salary - monthly_expenses
print("Monthly savings: " + str(round(monthly_savings, 2)))

# Forecast salary growth and cost of living
# Due to both inflation and increased productivity from experience, you can expect your salary to grow at different rates depending on your job. Now, since you are working in a growing and in-demand career field as a Data Scientist, you can assume a steady growth in your annual salary every year based on performance.
#
# You can assume an annual salary growth rate of 5%, which means if you start at $85,000 per year, you can expect to earn over $176,000 per year after 15 years. After taxes, assuming your tax rate hasn't changed, that works out to roughly $125,000 per year, which is not unreasonable for a Data Scientist. In fact, you might even make it to that level in a few years! But just to be safe, you should be conservative with your projections.
#
# For this application, assume all inflation and salary growth happens in smaller increments on a monthly basis instead of just one large increase at the end of each year.
#
# monthly_takehome_salary from the previous exercise is available.

# Create monthly forecasts up to 15 years from now
forecast_months = 12*15

# Set your annual salary growth rate

# Calculate the actual salary forecast
salary_forecast = monthly_takehome_salary*cumulative_salary_growth_forecast

# Plot the forecasted salary
fig = plt.figure()
plt.plot(salary_forecast, color='blue')

# Forecast growing expenses due to inflation
# You will also assume your monthly expenses will rise by an average of 2.5% per year due to inflation. This will lead to higher cost of living over time, paying for the same expenses each year but at a higher price. Luckily, your salary is growing faster than inflation, which means you should have more money going into savings each month.

# Calculate your net worth
# Now that you have forecasted your savings and salary over time while taking career progression and inflation into account, you have constructed a time-series which you can use to calculate your cash flows, just like in Chapter 1.
#
# For this example, all you need to do is subtract your forecasted monthly expenses from your forecasted monthly salary. The remaining cash flow will go straight into your savings account for each month.

# So you want to be a millionaire?
# Your projections show that you can accumulate over $700,000 in just 15 years by following a strict budget and growing your salary steadily over time.
#
# But you want to be a millionaire in 15 years, retire young, sip margaritas and travel for the rest of your life. In order to do that, you're going to need to invest.
#
# Remember the .pmt() function from numpy? You can use this function to calculate how much you need to save each month in order to accumulate your desired wealth over time.
#
# You still have a lot to learn about the stock market, but your financial advisor told you that you can earn anywhere from 5-10% per year on your capital on
# average by investing in a low cost index fund.
#
# You know that the stock market doesn't always go up, but you will assume a modest 7% return per year, which has been the average annual return
# in the US stock market from 1950-2009.

# Investing a percentage of your income (I)
# Unfortunately, you really can't afford to save $3,000 per month in order to amass $1,000,000 after only 15 years.
#
# But what you can do is start slowly, investing a small percentage of your take-home income each month, which should grow over time as your income grows as well.
#
# In this exercise, you will lay the foundations to simulate this investing process over time.
#
# The salary_forecast and expenses_forecast variables are available from the previous exercise.
